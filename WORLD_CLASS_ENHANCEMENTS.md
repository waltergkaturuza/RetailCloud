## 🎯 **QUICK WINS** (Can Implement Fast)

1. **Notification System** - WebSocket already set up, just need models + UI

3. **API Documentation** - Use Django REST Framework's built-in tools
4. **Customer Segmentation** - RFM analysis logic exists, need UI

## 💡 **Which Should We Start With?**

I recommend starting with **Real-Time Notifications System** because:
- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure already exists

- ✅ Immediate value to users
- ✅ Foundation for other real-time features

**Or** we could start with **Employee Management** if HR is more critical for your users.
